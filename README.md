# Arrays-Lab-Assignment

Arrays Lab Part 1 (random) - 60 Points

Write code that will create an array that will hold a random number of int values. The random number of int values must be calculated using the Math class random method. The random number of int values must be in the range of 3 to 8, inclusive.
Using a for loop and the length field, write code that will put a random int value into each element of the int array. The random int values that will be put into the
elements of the array must be in the range of 1 to 10, inclusive and must be calculated using the Math class random method.

Arrays Lab Part 2 (for) - 70 Points

Write code that will add up all the values in the array to create a total value. The code must use a for loop to traverse the array. You must use the Arrays class toString() method to cause the array element values to be printed in the “[value, value, value]” format shown below.
Write code that cause output that looks like this: 
(Your array may be a different size and will probably have different values.)
Original Array [7, 2, 15, 1, 5, 2, 5] 
The values in the Original Array add up to 37

Arrays Lab Part 3 (while) - 85 Points

Write code that will determine if each value in the array is even or if it is odd. If the value is odd, you must also determine if it is also a prime number. The code must use a while loop to traverse the array. The Arrays class sort() method will be of great help here.
Write code that cause output that looks like this: 
Original Array [7, 2, 15, 1, 5, 2, 5] 
1 - prime
2 - even
2 - even
5 - prime
5 - prime
7 - prime 
15 - odd


Arrays Lab Part 4 (you choose) - 100 Points
Write code that will determine how many times each value occurs in the array. You may use either the for loop or while loop to traverse the array. You may need to put one loop inside another. 
Write code that cause output that looks like this: 
Original Array [7, 2, 15, 1, 5, 2, 5] 
1 - 1
2 - 2
5 - 2
7 - 1
15 - 1
